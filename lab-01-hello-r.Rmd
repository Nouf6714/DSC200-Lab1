### Lab Exercise

(Type your answer to the Exercise here.

See 'Load Packages' above as an example. Delete everything in these brackets after typing your answer.)

```{r}
dino_data <- datasaurus_dozen %>% 
  filter(dataset == "dino")
```
#tasks
```{r}
ggplot(data = dino_data, mapping = aes(x = x, y = y)) +      geom_point()
```

```{r}
star_data <- datasaurus_dozen %>%
filter(dataset == "star")
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = star_data, mapping = aes(x = x, y = y)) +
geom_point()
```

```{r}
circle_data <- datasaurus_dozen %>%
filter(dataset == "circle")
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = circle_data, mapping = aes(x = x, y = y)) +
geom_point()
```
